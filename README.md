Transcripts in markdown of episodes of the This Developer's Life Podcast. This will be posted on the ThisDevelopersLife.com podcast website and be used for SEO, indexing, but more importantly to introduce the deaf and hard of hearing to our show. These transcripts will also be useful for folks learning English to follow along with the show.
