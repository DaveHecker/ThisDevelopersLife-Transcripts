ThisDevelopersLife-Transcripts
==============================

Transcripts in markdown of episodes of the This Developer's Life Podcast. This will be posted on the ThisDevelopersLife.com podcast website and be used for SEO, indexing, but more importantly to introduce the deaf and hard of hearing to our show. These transcripts will also be useful for folks learning English to follow along with the show.

##Get Involved
You can check out the issues tab https://github.com/shanselman/ThisDevelopersLife-Transcripts/issues and see who is already transcribing a show. Shows should be in in Markdown. 

##File Naming
Name your files like this and PR them. Don't start a file unless you've claimed it in the issue for that show. Perhaps work as a team and split work up. Let's make these very tidy!
