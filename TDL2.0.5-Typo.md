Geoffrey: I used to subscribe to a magazine called Metropolis; which is more about architecture but they also had this kind of variety of ideas in there. They had one font that was just absolutely beautiful, that I just thought, "Wow, this is amazing". The first time I saw it the headline was about George W Bush and I just stared at that for literally 20 or 30 minutes examining all the different letters. It was just incredible. I was like that is the most amazing typeface that I've ever seen.

Rob: That's Geoffrey Grosenbach once again, waxing poetic on fonts. 

?: It was kind of angular but it wasn't square. It has some kind of trainglur ideas in there and yet hte lines all looked like they were the same width. SO everything just kind of looked straight. But, in order to achieve that effect you actually have to make things thicker in some places and thinner when they join up with other lines. You have to do things to lines in order to make them look like they're straight and in fact they're not. They're bending in at different points or something like that and they way they'd done that just looked really great.
