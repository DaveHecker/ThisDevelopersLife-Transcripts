### Scars

Rob: Hey, Scott. Dude, I have a *great* idea - let's do a podcast. We can do a thing like [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/), and I'll loop in some groovy tunes... what do you think?

Scott: *What* are you talking about? I mean, what is this... what is this awful music? There's too much music. We should try something that sounds a little more like *(sings the [Hanselminutes](http://hanselminutes.com/) theme)*.

Rob: Oh come on, ok just play along. Alright, I'll get to the point. If this podcast didn't exist, and I just got you one day while you were, I don't know, installing some kind of service pack or something, and I said "Dude let's do a podcast where you riff, and I play music in the background, and we talk to people who are miserable...what do you think you would say?"

Scott: I would probably say that it's been done before, I would probably stop pronouncing my L's... and uh, honestly, really I mean I've listened to your music. I don't want to listen to your weird hippie music. I would tell you to do a podcast without the music, call it *Coneryminutes*...

Rob: Ok... you know, yeah, music, where have I heard that before? Oh yeah, your blog. Oh man, the comments on your blog every time you put up a show. But you know...

Scott: You take it too personally.

Rob: I know, I must. But you should know by now that making fun of me is painful, at least as far as you're concerned with, with this show.

Scott: Yep, you are an angsty teenage girl. But I personally have had a great time, you know, listening to what you do with my voice, using the high quality professional tools like... GarageBand. Uh, seriously though... what is this music? This is a problem.

Rob (with deep voice effect): Uh, what if the show this week is Rob playing with GarageBand while Scott brings his wife and family on, and you dump in some awful music... it's just this incredibly compelling, very emo stuff. What is the point to this show, again?

Rob: *(laughing)* Oh, that never, ever gets old. Ok so here's my point. I'm genuinely curious - what would you have said about my podcast pitch to you? I mean I'll tell you what I think, right? If I say to you, "Hey Scott, let's do a podcast," right, and this podcast didn't exist - you would say, "No way." I mean, you're like Mr. Geek Hollywood. How many podcasts are you on? How many recording are made of you each week, or day... each hour, right?

Scott: Maybe, I mean I probably would have been skeptical, but no more skeptical than if you'd invited me over for tacos and said, "Hey I've got a great business opportunity for you." Nobody wants to get involved in yet another failure.

Rob: You know, true. But I think you would probably have been a little more than skeptical. But alright, ok, so I'll let that go. Here's my point. You have got a squelch filter - a geek squelch filter - that is set pretty high. I mean, you know squelch filter, like the button on your kid's...

Scott: Right, right, I know what a squelch filter is. Right, increases the signal-to-noise by reducing the noise... and also the incredibly bad music, and... it filters out the nonsense, yes. No programmer is a fan of nonsense, and no one wants to waste people's time. I mean, my whole other podcast is dedicated to not wasting people's time. Like right now... I think you're about to come to your point?

Rob: Right, I get that. Ok, so to my point. How did your squelch filter get set so high?

Scott: You have to fail! I've failed a lot. I've been involved in a lot of dead end projects, deathmarches I suppose you could call them. And as you can imagine, myself... or I'm sure any kind of relatively senior engineer... hears a lot of ideas from people. You always get pitched. I'll listen to anybody for a couple of tacos, but that doesn't mean I'm going to sign in as your CTO. Like, a buddy of mine... years ago we have this joke, which is "expiredfoods.com - your B2B marketplace for food that has reached its expiration date." My buddy Joe... convinced that this is a great business idea. We all have the kind of like, "Dude... expiredfoods.com - we have to make this happen. Quit your job, move into my garage, it's going to be *awesome*..."

Rob: Ok, so of course to anybody listening now, that has a few projects under their belt, I mean of course that sounds horrible. And in fact I'm sure there are some people out there who are saying, "You know... I've actually worked on a project like that." My point being, is that now of course with hindsight, you can easily make that call. You can say, "Oh, expiredfoods.com sounds horrible." But when you're just getting started, when you just start programming... you know you're starting to build web sites, and you think "hey this is really cool." Don't you think it's a little harder to make that choice?

Scott: Because you're not jaded. You don't have the scars. If you haven't gone on a deathmarch, you don't know enough to... say "Gosh I don't think that's a good idea." You don't have the... you know how you get code smell? You develop code smell? You have to get project smell.

Rob: Exactly.

Scott: Going, "Hey, let's all go on a hike in the desert without water. That would be awesome. Let's do that." 

Rob: Well you know it's funny that you bring that up, because... so whenever you go out with geeks, I'm sure like when you go out on your Nerd Dinners, people sit around the table and they start at some point kvetching, right? Someone will lift up their geek sleeve, and say "Look at these scars *I've* got." And then, you know you start bantering back and forth... well, like these guys.
